# Possible data-questions to further analysis:
- Which types of data are most frequently exposed in breaches?
- What is the distribution of breach sizes across different data types?
- Which industries experience the most breaches involving sensitive data (e.g., SSNs, health records)?
- What are the most common breach methods used to access each data type?
- Is there a relationship between breach method and data type exposed?
- Do certain industries have consistent patterns in the types of data they lose?
- Are data types with higher exposure counts also those with higher breach severities or costs?
- Is company size or country of operation related to the type of data breached?
- Given the breach method and industry, can we predict which data types are at risk?
- Can we model the likelihood of high-sensitivity data being breached based on organization profile?
